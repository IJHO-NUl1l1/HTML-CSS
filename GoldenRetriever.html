        <h3>History of Golden Retrievers</h3>
        <a href="https://grca.org/">Golden Retrievers</a> were developed in Scotland in the 19th century initially as <strong>hunting dogs.</strong> <br>
        Their primary role was to retrieve game for hunters, doing so gently <strong>without harming the catch, thanks to their soft mouths.</strong> <br>
        Today, they are primarily loved as companion animals and sometimes serve as rescue dogs or assistance dogs for the disabled.

        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
        Golden Retrievers are known for being <strong>friendly, loyal, and obedient.</strong> <br>
        They are highly intelligent and trainable due to their eagerness to please their owners. <br>
        They have a sturdy build and long coats, and they thrive on active living.

        <h3>Webbed Feet</h3>
        Golden Retrievers have <strong>webbed feet</strong> that allow them to move efficiently in water, <br>
        enhancing their ability to perform in aquatic hunting and rescue operations. <br>
        The webbing helps increase the surface area of their feet in water, aiding in more powerful swimming.

        <h3>Cautions</h3>
        Like many large breeds, Golden Retrievers require ample exercise. Regular grooming and care are also necessary. <br>
        This breed is sociable, so it is not recommended to leave them alone for long periods.<br>

        <h3>Common Health Issues</h3>
        Golden Retrievers can have some genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, heart diseases, <br>
        and they are prone to high rates of cancer. <br>
