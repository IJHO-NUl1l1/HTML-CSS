        <h3>History of Border Collies</h3>
        Border Collies originate from the borderlands between Scotland and England, where they were primarily bred as sheep herding dogs. <br>
        They are renowned for their intelligence, agility, and the intense stare, known as "the eye," which they use to control and herd sheep.
